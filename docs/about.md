  - Single cell RNAseq pipeline (10X data, BAM files, Fastq files, RSEM, …)
  - Seurat package
  - Monocle
  - Clustering (k-means, KNN, DBSCAN, HAC, …)
  - Dimension Reduction (PCA, tSNE, UMAP)
  - Matrix Factorization (SVD, NMF)
  - Optimal Number of feature identification
  - Velocity
  - Cell Cycle Analysis
  - Differentially expressed genes
